# PythonMiniProject
Mini-project for the Python for Biologist class at Pwani University

## Introduction
The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is an important resource that contains information of 3D structures of large biological molecules. The information can be access through the website (http://www.pdb.org/)

## Contents
The project is broken into the following sections.

### Section 1
* [Data](Data/) Some pdb files used to test the software during development 

### Section 2
* [Notebooks](Notebooks/pdbSoftwareTools.ipynb) Functions or codes for the software

### Section 3
* [Project Instructions](Project_instructions) Contains the guidlines that were followed to develop the software

### Section 4
* [Scripts](Scripts/runPdbSoftware.py) The script for the information extractor 

### Section 4
* [README](README.md) The project at a glance

This is project was done with the main refference material availabe at [Introduction to Python for Bioinformatics](https://github.com/kipkurui/Python4Bioinformatics2019)


## Credits
